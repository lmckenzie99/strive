Observation 1:  
- A combination of routine and strong notifications were the strongest reasons for opening the app consistently.
- The data supporting this was that 49.4% of responders selected push notifications as being helpful as one of three of their choices. The other data point supporting this is that 54.3% of people selected routine as one of three of their choices.
- Our team action is to concentrate focus on notifications during the U/I development. 

Observation 2:
 
The majority of respondents prefer seeing key metrics with the option to explore details further. When it comes to displaying spending information, users tend to favor clear, number-focused summaries over more creative comparisons.

- **80.2%** prefer a **moderate** amount of information.  
- **12.3%** prefer a **minimal** summary.  
- **7.4%** prefer **detailed** information upfront.  
- **44.4%** strongly prefer and **19.8%** somewhat prefer the **number-focused** spending summary (Option A).  
- **23.5%** somewhat prefer and **4.9%** strongly prefer the **relatable comparison** (Option B).
 
Design dashboards to show key metrics upfront with optional drill-down details. Prioritize number-based spending summaries while offering relatable comparisons as secondary context.
