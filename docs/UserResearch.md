Observation 1:  
- A combination of routine and strong notifications were the strongest reasons for opening the app consistently.
- The data supporting this was that 49.4% of responders selected push notifications as being helpful as one of three of their choices. The other data point supporting this is that 54.3% of people selected routine as one of three of their choices.
- Our team action is to concentrate focus on notifications during the U/I development. 

Observation 2:
 
The majority of respondents prefer seeing key metrics with the option to explore details further. When it comes to displaying spending information, users tend to favor clear, number-focused summaries over more creative comparisons.

- **80.2%** prefer a **moderate** amount of information.  
- **12.3%** prefer a **minimal** summary.  
- **7.4%** prefer **detailed** information upfront.  
- **44.4%** strongly prefer and **19.8%** somewhat prefer the **number-focused** spending summary (Option A).  
- **23.5%** somewhat prefer and **4.9%** strongly prefer the **relatable comparison** (Option B).
 
Design dashboards to show key metrics upfront with optional drill-down details. Prioritize number-based spending summaries while offering relatable comparisons as secondary context.

Observation 3:  

Most users would prefer to interact with their saving goals by setting them and being able to forget about it and let automatic transfers take over, and to track their spending they would like it to be mopstly automatic with some manual categorization options.  

- **42.0%** prefer to track spending Mostly automatic, occasional manual categorization  
- **56.8%** How would you want to interact with your savings goals

Ensure the tracking past setting goals is mostly automatic  

Observation 4:  

- Users find billing reminders and progress tracking the most helpful which signals that these messages will be pivotal for maintaining users.
- More users indicated that a daily spending summary would be a more helpful message than having a daily streak reminder.
- Insights show that messages regarding billing, progress tracking and daily spending are the ideal messages users want to see.
  
Observation 5:  

Most users would prefer to have spending patterns communicated to them either by suggestion or direct message.
- **30.9%** want a suggestion, "Try making coffee at home2x/week to save $40/month"
- **25.9%** want a direct message, "You buy coffee out 5x/week".  
Overall, out of five options a majority fell above 20% preference.  
An action learned from this is to give users an option in settings, but have the default option set to suggestion.
